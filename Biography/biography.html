                                    <strong>Ram Railey B. Alin</strong>, 19 years old of age, is a University of Cebu student, currently studying Bachelor of Science in Information Technology. He completed his Junior High School and Senior High School at <i>Tisa National High School</i>. Currently, he resides in Barangay Tisa, known for its delicacy of <strong>siomai</strong>. He likes to read wuxia, xianxia, and manga. He occasionally frequents YouTube and Facebook as a way to relax his spirit whenever times are tough. He also claims to be an avid fan of knowledge, and is a huge science lover. As such, he also adore reading articles of such nature.

                                    Specifically, he loves knowing a lot about the universe and the mysteries that lie within. When he was a child, access to the internet remained close which gave him the lucky opportunity to be digitally literate at a young age. Despite that, he believes that that event wasn't what made him to who he is currently. He believes that his neverending curiosity for the unknown is what has always been ingrained in him since he was born. As such, he otherwise claims to be <i>sensory weak</i> or inherently fragile when it comes to interacting with the real world. He believes that the world of sensory experience only makes up a fraction of what makes a human, human. He thinks that the wonderful world of ideas must be explored as well and attempt to imagine theories that could be helpful for mankind. Friedrich Nietzsche, one of his favorite philosophers once said that:
                                </p>
